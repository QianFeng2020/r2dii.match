\title{Add the column \code{sector} (as classified by 2dii) and \code{borderline}}
\usage{
bridge_sector(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A loanbook dataframe.}
}
\value{
A loanbook dataframe with additional \code{sector} and \code{borderline}
columns.
}
\description{
This function adds two columns, \code{sector} and \code{borderline}:
\itemize{
\item \code{sector}: \code{sector} gives climate-relevant sectors looked up from standard
sector classifications in production databases.
\item \code{borderline}: Indicates if the classification is borderline or not.
}
}
\details{
A company acts in a climate-relevant sector if it meets two conditions:
\enumerate{
\item It is classified in one of the sectors that translate 1 to 1 from a a
standard sector classification to a climate-relevant sector covered by the
PACTA analysis (e.g. utilities to power).
\item It is classified in a sector that can but does not necessarily map to a
climate-relevant sector covered by the PACTA analysis (e.g. power
grid/network to Power, general mining to coal mining).
}
