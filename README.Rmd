The goal of r2dii.match is to match generic loanbook data with physical asset level data (ald).

## Installation

Install the development version of r2dii.match from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.match")
```

## Example

We'll use required packages from r2dii, and some convenient packages from the tidyverse.

```{r}
library(r2dii.match)
library(r2dii.dataraw)
library(tidyverse)
```

The process for matching loanbook and ald datasets has multiple steps:

### 1. Create two datasets: [loanbook](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/loanbook_description.html) and [asset-level data (ald)](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/ald_description.html)

Start by creating datasets like [`loanbook_demo`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/loanbook_demo.html) and [`ald_demo`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw/reference/ald_demo.html) (from the [r2dii.dataraw package](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.dataraw)).

```{r}
loanbook_demo

ald_demo
```

You may use these datasets as a template:

* Write _loanbook\_demo.csv_ and _ald\_demo.csv_ with:

```r
# Writting to current working directory 
loanbook_demo %>% 
  write_csv(path = "loanbook_demo.csv")

ald_demo %>% 
  write_csv(path = "ald_demo.csv")
```

* In each dataset, replace our demo data with your data.

* Save save each dataset as, say, _your\_loanbook.csv_ and _your\_ald.csv_.

* Read your datasets back into R with:

```r
# Reading from current working directory 
your_loanbook <- read_csv("your_loanbook.csv")
your_ald <- read_csv("your_ald.csv")
```

Here we'll continue to use the `*_demo` datasets.

```{r}
warning("Skip this chunk to avoid overwriting your data with our demo data.")

your_loanbook <- loanbook_demo
your_ald <- ald_demo
```

### 2. Score the goodness of the match between the loanbook and ald datasets

`match_name()` scores the match between names in a loanbook dataset (lbk; columns `name_direct_loantaker` and `name_ultimate_parent`) with names in an asset-level dataset (ald; column `name_company`). The raw names are first transformed and stored in the columns `alias_lbk` and `alias_ald`, then the similarity between them is scored using `stringdist::stringsim()`. 

The process to create the `alias_*` columns applies best-practices commonly used in name matching algorithms, such as:

* Remove special characters.
* Replace language specific characters.
* Abbreviate certain names to reduce their importance in the matching.
* Spell out numbers to increase their importance.

```{r}
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald)
```

By default, `alias_lbk` and `alias_ald` are scored only by sector. `by_sector = FALSE` removes this limitation, increasing computation time, and the number of nonsensical matches. 

```{r}
match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, by_sector = FALSE)
```

`min_score` allows you to pick rows of a minimum `score` and above.

```{r}
matching_scores <- match_name(your_loanbook, your_ald, min_score = 0.9)

matching_scores
```

### 3. Write the output of the previous step into a .csv file

Write the output of the previous step into a .csv file with:

```r
# Writting to current working directory 
matching_scores %>%
  write_csv("matching_scores.csv")
```

### 4. Compare, edit, and save the data manually

* Open _matching_scores.csv_ with any spreadsheet editor (e.g. MS Excel, Google Sheets).

* Visually compare `alias_lbk` and `alias_ald`, along with the loanbook sector.

* Edit the data manually:
    * If you are happy with the match, set the `score` value to `1`.
    * Otherwise set or leave the `score` value to anything other than `1`.

* Save the edited file as, say, _matching_scores_edited.csv_.

### 5. Re-read the data from the previous step

Re-read the data from the previous step with:

```r
# Reading from current working directory 
matching_scores %>%
  write_csv("matching_scores_edited.csv")
```

### 6. Join in validated matches in order of priority
